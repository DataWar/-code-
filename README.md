I do my coding mostly on Windows 10.  If I need to scale, I use Debian servers.

Once setup, you can setup the CLI or HTTP environment to run the necessary code.

There is a bit of casperjs (bad idea) or selenenium (good idea) within the python framework (argh!, but sometimes you must use crappy languages)
